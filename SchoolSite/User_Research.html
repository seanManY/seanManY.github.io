				<h2>User Interviews</h2>			
				<p id="project_text">User interviews can help guide you on what sort of content to put in a website or other application. I asked question about the interviewee to get a sense of who they are. This help me put into context what kind of person they are and put in perspective where their advice is coming from.</p>

				<h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>	
				<p id="project_text">A Cognitive Walkthrough consists of giving people a task or series of tasks and watching them perform those tasks. This brings up issues in the context of a hypothetical test. I prioritized the sites look and feel. </p>

				<h2>User Test</h2>	
				<p id="project_text">I chose to run a click test and a question test. The click test is a quick and painless test to give to people, they can complete it in less than a minute. The question test was designed as a low-effort cognitive walkthrough to gather more qualitative data on how to improve the site. </p>

		<div id="SummaryFindings">
			<h1 id="about_heading">SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</h1>
			<p id=about_body>Majority of the people that I have interviewed were friends and colleagues. People that I can trust for an honest opinion and they gave me a honest opinion. Off the bat I had a pretty good idea on how I wanted content layed out. What I quickly found out was that my perspective differs from others. Something that is clear to me is not clear to the general mass of people, or even like-minded individuals. 
	This project has helped me recontextualize the diversity of people who would view my website. I am now able to see things from multiple perspectives and use that information to redesign the site. The cognitive walkthrough helped to give some one-on-one intimate details on what to improve while the user testing helped giving me quantitative data on how to improve the site.

		<div id="IncorporationFindings">
			<h1 id="about_heading">Incorporation of Findings</h1>
			<p id=about_body>The biggest complaint I got was my lack of color. I wanted to go for a hipster grayscale aesthetic, but it seems that was not well received. So I intend to take off the grayscale “filter” on all the photos and incorporate a color scheme. The other major point was the concept of character, I got conflicting report about this. Half of participants said that the sight had my personal flair while the other half said that it was lacking or the site was unprofessional. This was in reference to the section headings. Since I do not have a majority consensus on the matter I plan to keep the headings but make the content as professional as possible. For example I will get rid of the “wordy” description and replace them with tags. This will allow people to quickly glance at what tools were used for each project and get a more detailed description on each project when clicked on.
	The biggest word of advice I received was “show people what you do”. I want to show people, upfront, what I do. And what I do is make video games. I want to create a landing page of a small game where the user needs to complete to access the site. Ideally have two versions that i’ll be accessible for mobile users as well. The plan is to make the game in javascript but it may be easier to make the game in Unity and export the game as a web game.
